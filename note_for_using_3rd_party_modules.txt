we need to round the command in the terminal to tell our
application we want to use NPM modules:
npm init

Then the package.jason will appear and this the where 
we difine the 3rd party modules we want to install in
our application. Use the following command in terminal to 
install the module (e.g. lodash):
npm install lodash --save

the --save is used to update the contents of package.jason. 
The module will be live in the node_modules folder.

The property 'dependencies' in package.jason will be updated.

Since we have the information of 3rd party modules in package.jason,
we can delete the node_modules folder and copy the folder to friends
or put it on the github. 
If we want to get the node_modules folder back, we just use the command
in terminal (without any module name):
npm install

then the node_modules folder will be back in the folder since the 
property 'dependencies' in package.jason contains all the info we need.
