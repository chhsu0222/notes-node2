use the following command to enter the debug mode:
node inspect XXX.js

The code will not be executed. It pauses before any of our code run.
We need use 'n' to run the next line;
or use 'c' (stands for continue) to execute the code to the end of the code
or to the 'debugger' mark. 
To setup the 'debugger' mark just need to type 'debugger;' in the code. 
When use 'n' to go to the next line, it will not run the code of the line
untill it goes to the next line. 
(e.g. we pause at line 5, it only executed at line 4.)
Just like the break point in Visual studio.

The command: list(10) 
prints the 10 lines above and below the line we pause.

The command: repl  
Enter the repl mode (stands for re-evaluate print loop)
Just like the console in the chrome developer tools.
using control c to get back to the debug mode

using control c twice to shut down the debugger

////////////////////////////////////////////

Using the chrome Dev tool
command: node --inspect-brk XXX.js 
(brk means we want a break before that first line)

Then turn on chrome and type: chrome://inspect
-> we will go to the following page: chrome://inspect/#devices
-> click "Open dedicated DevTools for Node"

The blue button does exactly what 'c' does in the command line.
Click at the beginning of the line to set (add) the break point.
